### Our Philosophy

 - **Empower the people**: Give people the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain easily, without having to run a full node.
 - **Make it easy & free**: Everyone should be able to create a wallet and send Ether & Tokens without additional cost.
 - **People are the Priority**: People are the most important & their experience trumps all else. If monetization worsens the experience, we don't do it. (e.g. ads)
 - **A learning experience, too**: We want to educate about Ethereum, security, privacy, the importance of controlling your own keys, how the blockchain works, and how Ethereum and blockchain technologies enable a better world.
 - **If it can be hacked, it will be hacked**: Never save, store, or transmit secret info, like passwords or keys.
 - **Offline / Client-Side**: User should be able to run locally and offline without issue.
 - **Private**: No tracking!!! No emails. No ads. No demographics. We don't even know how many wallets have been generated, let alone who / what / where you are.
In case you are not familiar, you need to keep the entire folder in order to run the website, not just index.html. Don't touch or move anything around in the folder. If you are storing a backup of the MyEtherWallet repo for the future, we recommend just storing the ZIP so you can be sure the folder contents stay intact.
